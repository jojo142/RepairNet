## Product Summary:
RepairNet is a facilities request tracker designed for Brandeis University students. It allows students to submit and monitor their maintenance requests seamlessly through the university’s housing portal, using their Brandeis login credentials. This tool aims to improve the efficiency of facilities management by providing students with real-time updates on their requests and scheduled maintenance visits in order to enhance student life experience for all the college students living on campus.

## Problem Solved:
Students currently experience frustration with the lack of transparency and communication in the facilities request process. Many encounter delays, miscommunications, and the inconvenience of multiple platforms. RepairNet addresses these pain points by centralizing the request process, providing timely notifications, and improving communication between students and facilities teams.

## Vision:
To create an efficient and transparent process for managing and tracking maintenance requests, allowing students to stay informed and plan their schedules around scheduled repairs. RepairNet streamlines interaction between students and the facilities department by leveraging the university’s existing infrastructure.

## Testing and Results
We will use these mockups and test them with Brandeis students to gather feedback on usability, intuitiveness, and layout. Testing would include one-on-one usability sessions where users perform tasks such as submitting a request and tracking it on the dashboard. Insights gained would inform design refinements as we move forward.

## Key Testing Goals:
Usability Testing: Essentially we will measure how easily students can navigate the system, submit a request, and track its status. Assess whether the dashboard is intuitive and clear.
Feedback Collection: We plan to use a combination of surveys and interviews to gather feedback on the most useful features, desired improvements, and any areas of confusion.

Early Results:
Based on initial feedback from students, and their response to our product we will analyze the demand. We believe notifications and the tracking dashboard were identified as the most critical features. Some excited users of the current system suggested additional notification types, such as text message alerts.
